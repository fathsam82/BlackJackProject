# BlackJackProject
The goal of my project was to create a functioning BlackJack game application. Upon starting the program, the user is prompted to play or quit the application. If they choose play, they will be dealt cards and will be given an option to hit or stand. After a bust or stand, the program prompts the dealer to show their hidden card and the hand values get compared, resulting in one winner.
# Description
While my application was running, I used a while loop to iterate through different methods that contained the logic needed to play the game of BlackJack. I created an instance of both the player and the dealer to be able to use their hand values within my code. The initial deal method came first, which dealt the cards to the player and dealer. Then the players turn method initiates, where the user can choose to hit or stand, based off output of their hands' value. The dealer turn method came next, where conditions were set to make sure they hit while their hands' value was under 17. The results method came next, where based off of each players' hand value, the program would declare a winner, loser, or push outcome.

# Technologies Used
-Java
-Eclipse

# Lessons Learned
I learned about creating Enums and using a constructor to reference them in the desired data type.
I reinforced my understanding of creating an instance of a class to be able to use it's methods.
I applied new knowledge to be able to implement concrete methods within an abstract class.
